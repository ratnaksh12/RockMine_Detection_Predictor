# RockMine_Detection_Predictor
The **RockMine Detection Predictor** is a machine learning project that classifies sonar signals to determine whether they represent rocks or mines. Utilizing logistic regression, this predictive model demonstrates effective classification based on sonar data features.

## Features
- **Binary Classification**: Distinguishes between sonar signals classified as rocks (R) or mines (M).
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 83% accuracy on training data and 76% on test data.
- **Predictive System**: Implements a fast input processing system using NumPy for efficient predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the model and processing data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the logistic regression model and evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
The project uses a sonar dataset containing 208 instances and 60 features. The dataset is balanced to ensure effective training and testing of the model.
